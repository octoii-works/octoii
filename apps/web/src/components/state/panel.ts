 * The panel, one for the app: where it stands — hidden, beside the page's column, or filling the column's place, as

 * tab shown; the file its Files view reads, and the folders open in its tree; the changes its Diff view shows — so a
 * thread finds its own as the person comes back to it. Its terminals and its pages in the browser are the node's, a
 * tab each after the views, never kept here. Anything that names a path opens it there: a file chosen in the tree or
 * named in a message is read, a folder a search finds or a message names is opened in the tree. A store of the page's,
