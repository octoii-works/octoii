/**
 * A turn of the thread, as the rows of the timeline draw it: the words that began it, or that steered it on — the
 * person's, a task its parent gave it, or what came of one it gave a sub-thread in the background; each part of its
 * work, laid out alike while it works and once it ended — what it said on its way, each stretch of calls a line that
 * opens to its steps, what it thought — so nothing of it moves as it ends; then its reply, a block at a time; and its
 * end: the files it changed, what waits on the person, why it failed where it did, and, as its last line, what it does
 * now and how long it has worked while it works, or its foot once it ended. A turn that works only grows as it goes:
 * its parts are added at the end, and what it does now changes its words in one line of its own, so nothing of it
 * moves back as it calls its tools.
