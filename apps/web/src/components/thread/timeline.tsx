/**
 * A thread's timeline: its rows in a column of the chat's width — each turn laid out flat, its words, each part of its
 * work, its reply and its end, and what is the thread's own between turns — in the order their ids give, on a list
 * that draws the rows in view alone, each as tall as it measures, so a long thread, its images among it, costs what is
 * seen. It opens at its end and keeps to it as it grows while the reader is there — gliding while the thread works,
 * where motion is not asked to be less, as the list follows a reply that streams only so without moving what is read
 * back; at once otherwise — and lets be once they scroll up, a button bringing them back down; what the person last
 * sent stands near the top, the reply growing under it, space kept below it till the reply fills the room; a row above
 * what is read that grows or shrinks moves nothing read, as earlier turns read in above it do not.
 * Nothing of the thread stands till its latest entries are read; then its rows fade in, so a thread opens rather than
 * appears; and each row that comes after fades in as it does, once. Above the rows, where the client holds the latest
 * of the log alone, a button that reads further back. The list takes the room between the page's header and what
 * docks at its foot.
