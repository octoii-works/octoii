/**
 * Markdown as the assistant and the person write it: GitHub's flavour, no raw HTML; a link to a page opening in the
 * browser, one to a path of the machine — from the thread's folder, whole, or a `file:` address — a chip that opens it
 * in the panel; a paragraph of images of the machine's files alone drawn as pictures side by side, an image among words
 * a chip of its file, one of the web a link to it, never fetched, as an address in a picture would tell a page what the
 * page holds; a page of the thread's browser that `::page` points at as its card, a thread `:thread` names as its chip
 * — a dot of how it stands and its title — the other directives as they were
 * written; each code block in a well of its own, its code plain while it is still being written; and a table scrolled
 * within itself where it is wider than its column. Text that is whole is read once: what it draws is kept by the text,
 * so a block drawn again — scrolled back to, or its thread opened again — is not read anew.
