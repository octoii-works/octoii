 * every id is minted in the order the log is written: the person's words cut a turn into parts, a step stands at its
 * request, what a reply said at the reply, a compaction — the thread's — among the work of the turn whose span holds
 * it, else a row of its own between turns, and what waits on the person that no call asks likewise. What the log holds in `ai`'s vocabulary is read
 * through schemas of the parts the page shows, each call's line by what the page knows of its tool. A turn that ended
 * is read once and kept, as the client keeps it the same; a call's line is kept while its call and what it waits on the
 * person for are the same — so a thread that grows is read again only where it grew.
